          PWAs (Progressive Web App) are web apps developed using a number of specific
          technologies and standard
          patterns to allow them to take advantage of both web and native app features. For example, web apps are more
          discoverable — it's a lot easier and faster to visit a website than install an
          application, and you can also share web apps via a link. On the other hand, native apps are better integrated
          with the operating system and therefore offer a more
          seamless experience for the users. You can install a native app so that it works offline, and users love
          tapping their homescreen icons to easily access their favorite apps, rather than navigating to it using a
          browser. PWAs give us the ability to create web apps that can enjoy these same advantages.
          It's not a brand new concept — such ideas have been revisited many times on the web platform with various
          approaches in the past. Progressive Enhancement and responsive design already allow us to build mobile
          friendly websites. Working offline and installing apps was possible in the Firefox OS ecosystem a few years
          ago. PWAs, however, provide all this and more, without getting rid of any of the existing features that make
          the
          web great.

      <article class="paragraph-wraper">
        <p class="content-paragraph">
          As we hinted at above, PWAs are not created with a single technology. They
          represent a new philosophy for building web apps, involving some specific patterns, APIs, and other features.
          It's not that obvious if a web app is a PWA or not from first glance. An app could be considered a PWA when it
          meets certain requirements, or implements a set of given features: works offline, is installable, is easy to
          synchronize, can send push notifications, etc. In addition, there are tools to measure the completeness of an
          app in percentages. (Lighthouse is currently
          the most popular one.) By implementing various technological advantages, we can make an app more progressive,
          thus ending up with a higher Lighthouse score. But this is only a rough indicator. There are some key
          principles a web app should try to observe to be identified as a PWA. It should be:
          <ul class="item-list">
            <li>Discoverable, so the contents can be found through search engines.</li>
            <li>Installable, so it's available on the device's home screen.</li>
            <li>Linkable, so you can share it by simply sending a URL.</li>
            <li>Network independent, so it works offline or with a poor network connection.</li>
            <li>Progressive, so it's still usable on a basic level on older browsers, but fully-functional on the latest
              ones.</li>
            <li>Re-engageable, so it's able to send notifications whenever there's new content available.</li>
            <li>Responsive, so it's usable on any device with a screen and a browser — mobile phones, tablets, laptops,
              TVs,
              fridges, etc.</li>
            <li>Safe, so the connection between you and the app is secured against any third parties trying to get
              access to
              your sensitive data.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <article class="paragraph-wraper">
        <p class="content-paragraph">
          As mentioned before, PWAs don't depend on a single API, but rather using various technologies to achieve the
          goal of delivering the best web experience possible.
          The key ingredient required for PWAs is service worker support. Thankfully service workers are now supported
          on all major browsers on desktop and mobile.
          Other features such as Web App Manifest, Push, Notifications, and Add to Home Screen functionality have wide
          support too. Currently, Safari has limited support for Web App Manifest and Add to Home Screen and no support
          for web push notifications. However, other major browsers support all these features.
          Some of these APIs are experimental, with the documentation still in draft, but seeing success stories like
          those of Flipkart and AliExpress should convince you to try and implement some of the PWA features in your web
          app already.
          Above all you should follow the progressive enhancement rule — use the technologies that provide such
          enhancements only where they are supported, but still offer the basic functionality of your app if it isn't.
          This way everybody will be able to use it, but those with modern browsers will benefit from PWA features even
          more.

    <section class="main-section" id="It_is_worth_doing_all_that">
      <header class="content-header">It is worth doing all that</header>
      <article class="paragraph-wraper">
        <p class="content-pargraph">
          Absolutely! With a relatively small amount of effort required to implement the core PWA features, the benefits
          are huge. For example:
          <ul class="item-list">
            <li>A decrease in loading times after the app has been installed, thanks to caching with Service Workers,
              along with saving precious bandwidth and time. PWAs have near-instantaneous loading (from the second
              visit).</li>
            <li>The ability to update only the content that has changed when an app update is available. In contrast,
              with a native app, even the slightest modification can force the user to download the entire application
              again.</li>
            <li>A look and feel that is more integrated with the native platform — app icons on the homescreen, apps
              that run fullscreen, etc.</li>
            <li>Re-engaging with users via system notifications and push messages, leading to more engaged users and
              better conversion rates.</li>
          </ul>
          There are many success stories of companies trying the PWA route, opting for an enhanced website experience
          rather than a native app, and seeing significant measurable benefits as a result. The website PWA Stats shares
          many case studies that indicate these benefits.
          The best-known success story is probably Flipkart Lite — India's largest e-commerce site rebuilt as a
          progressive web app in 2015, which resulted in 70% increase in conversions. The AliExpress PWA has also seen
          much better results than the web or native app, with a 104% increase in conversion rates for new users. Given
          their profit increase, and the relatively low amount of work required for the conversion to PWAs, the
          advantage is clear.
          Early stage emerging startups like couponmoto have also started using progressive web apps to drive more
          consumer engagement, showing that they can help small as well as big companies to (re-)engage users more
          effectively.
          You can check the list at pwa.rocks for more examples. Particularly worth mentioning is the hnpwa.com page —
          this lists an example implementation of the Hacker News website (instead of the usual TodoMVC app), in which
          you can see the use of various front-end frameworks.
          You can even generate PWAs online using the PWABuilder website.
          For service worker- and push- specific information, be sure to check the Service Worker Cookbook, a collection
          of recipes using service workers in modern sites.
          It's well worth trying out a PWA approach, so you can see for yourself if it works for your app.

          There are two main, different approaches to rendering a website — on the server or on the client. They both
          have their advantages and disadvantages, and you can mix the two approaches to some degree.
          <ul class="item-list">
            <li>Server-side rendering (SSR) means a website is rendered on the server, so it offers quicker first load,
              but navigating between pages requires downloading new HTML content. It works great across browsers, but it
              suffers in terms of time navigating between pages and therefore general perceived performance — loading a
              page requires a new round trip to the server.</li>
            <li>Client-side rendering (CSR) allows the website to be updated in the browser almost instantly when
              navigating to different pages, but requires more of an initial download hit and extra rendering on the
              client at the beginning. The website is slower on an initial visit, but can be faster to navigate.</li>
          </ul>
          Mixing SSR with CSR can lead to the best results — you can render a website on the server, cache its contents,
          and then update the rendering on the client-side as and when needed. The first page load is quick because of
          the SSR, and the navigation between pages is smooth because the client can re-render the page with only the
          parts that have changed.
          PWAs can be built using any approach you like, but some will work better than the others. The most popular
          approach is the "app shell" concept, which mixes SSR and CSR in exactly the way described above, and in
          addition follows the "offline first" methodology which we will explain in detail in upcoming articles and use
          in our example application. There is also a new approach involving the Streams API, which we'll mention
          briefly.

    <section class="main-section" id="App_Shell">
      <header class="content-header">App Shell</header>
      <article class="paragraph-wraper">
        <p class="content-paragraph">
          The App shell concept is concerned with loading a minimal user interface as soon as possible and then caching
          it so it is available offline for subsequent visits before then loading all the contents of the app. That way,
          the next time someone visits the app from the device, the UI loads from the cache immediately and any new
          content is requested from the server (if it isn’t available in the cache already).
          This structure is fast, and also feels fast as the user sees "something" instantly, instead of a loading
          spinner or a blank page. It also allows the website to be accessible offline if the network connection is not
          available.
          We can control what is requested from the server and what is retrieved from the cache with a service worker,
          which will be explained in detail in the next article — for now let's focus on the structure itself.

          This architecture allows a website to benefit the most from all the PWA features — it caches the app shell and
          manages the dynamic content in a way that greatly improves the performance. In addition to the basic shell,
          you can add other features such as add to home screen or push notifications, safe in the knowledge that the
          app will still work OK if they are not supported by the user's browser — this is the beauty of progressive
          enhancement.
          The website feels like a native app with instant interaction and solid performance while keeping all the
          benefits of the web.

          It's important to remember the PWA advantages and keep them in mind when designing the application. The app
          shell approach allows websites to be:
          <ul class="item-list">
            <li>Linkable: Even though it behaves like a native app, it is still a website — you can click on the links
              within the page and send a URL to someone if you want to share it.</li>
            <li>Progressive: Start with the "good, old basic website” and progressively add new features while
              remembering to detect if they are available in the browser and gracefully handle any errors that crop up
              if support is not available. For example, an offline mode with the help of service workers is just an
              extra trait that makes the website experience better, but it's still perfectly usable without it.</li>
            <li>Responsive: Responsive web design also applies to progressive web apps, as both are mainly for mobile
              devices. There are so many varied devices with browsers — it's important to prepare your website so it
              works on different screen sizes, viewports or pixel densities, using technologies like viewport meta tag,
              CSS media queries, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Different_Concept:_Stream">
      <header class="content-header">Different Concept: Stream</header>
      <article class="paragraph-wraper">
        <p class="content-paragraph">
          An entirely different approach to server- or client-side Rendering can be achieved with the Streams API. With
          a little help from service workers, streams can greatly improve the way we parse content.
          The app shell model requires all the resources to be available before the website can start rendering. It's
          different with HTML, as the browser is actually streaming the data already and you can see when the elements
          are loaded and rendered on the website. To have the JavaScript "operational", however, it has to be downloaded
          in its entirety.
          The Streams API allows developers to have direct access to data streaming from the server — if you want to
          perform an operation on the data (for example, adding a filter to a video), you no longer need to wait for all
          of it to be downloaded and converted to a blob (or whatever) — you can start right away. It provides
          fine-grained control — the stream can be started, chained with another stream, cancelled, checked for errors,
          and more.
          In theory, streaming is a better model, but it's also more complex, and at the time of writing (March 2018)
          the Streams API is still a work-in-progress and not yet fully available in any of the major browsers. When it
          is available, it will be the fastest way of serving the content — the benefits are going to be huge in terms
          of performance.
          For working examples and more information, see the Streams API documentation.

          <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> page (with title, description and place for a content), and
          <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> (copy and links).

          The app's only job is to list all the A-Frame entries from the js13kGames 2017 competition. As you can see it

        <p class="content-paragraph">
          The CSS is also as plain as possible: it uses @font-face to load and use a custom font, and it applies some
          simple styling of the HTML elements. The overall approach is to have the design look good on both mobile (with
          a responsive web design approach) and desktop devices.

        <h2>The main app JavaScript</h2>
        <p class="content-paragraph">
          The app.js file does a few things we will look into closely in the next articles. First of all it generates
          the content based on this template:
          <pre class="code-paragraph">
              <code>
                  var template = "&lt;article&gt;\n\
                  &lt;img src='data/img/SLUG.jpg' alt='NAME'&gt;\n\
                  &lt;h3&gt;#POS. NAME&lt;/h3&gt;\n\
                  &lt;ul&gt;\n\
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Author:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;AUTHOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Twitter:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href='https://twitter.com/TWITTER'&gt;@TWITTER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Website:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href='http://WEBSITE/'&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;GitHub:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href='https://GITHUB'&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\
                  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;More:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href='http://js13kgames.com/entries/SLUG'&gt;js13kgames.com/entries/SLUG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\
                  &lt;/ul&gt;\n\
              &lt;/article&gt;";
              var content = '';
              for(var i=0; i&lt;games.length; i++) {
                  var entry = template.replace(/POS/g,(i+1))
                      .replace(/SLUG/g,games[i].slug)
                      .replace(/NAME/g,games[i].name)
                      .replace(/AUTHOR/g,games[i].author)
                      .replace(/TWITTER/g,games[i].twitter)
                      .replace(/WEBSITE/g,games[i].website)
                      .replace(/GITHUB/g,games[i].github);
                  entry = entry.replace('&lt;a href=\'http:///\'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;','-');
                  content += entry;
              };
              document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = content;
